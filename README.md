# Neural Networks
---
This project is based on data set from a Kaggle Real estate dataset that lives [here](https://www.kaggle.com/harry007/philly-real-estate-data-set-sample)

## The Goal
To build a neural network model that classifies properties into price categories based on a number of feature inputs

The Philadelphia Real Estate dataset has 30 columns and over 600 rows.

### Model Feature Inputs
The following features were selected to train the model to predict on the Sales Price:
- Postal code
- Water
- PGW
- Rent Estimate
- taxAssessment
- yearBuilt
- SqFt
- Average comps
- bathrooms
- bedrooms
- Avg Walk&Transit score
- Violent Crime rate
- School Score

The model runs for 200 epochs with Adam used for the optimizer, cross entropy loss for the loss function, and the hidden layers use relu functions.

The classes for the labels were generated by categorizing properties by their Sales Price into 4 quartiles.
This is not an optimal approach. It removed the overhead of thinking deeply about errors as price estimations even by Realtors are often inaccurate. This stems from the external factors that affect the Sales price: negotiation, urgency to sell, incomplete information, and so on.

### Next Steps 
- Have the model predict prices and not price categories
- Chart the loss function and accuracy on a graph (training and test accuracy over epochs)
- Create comparisons on changing the activation functions, optimizer, # of layers
